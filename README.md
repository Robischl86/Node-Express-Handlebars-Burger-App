## Installation
This application requires an npm install of heroku, express, mysql, and express-handlebars.
## Usage
Users will enter the name of a new hamburger in the text field. Based on the radio button selection, the item will render in one of two categories: devoured or not-devoured. If a hamburger is not devoured, users can click to either devour or delete the hamburger. If a hamburger is devoured, users can either delete the object or order another.
